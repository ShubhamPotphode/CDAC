  adding: docs/file2.txt (stored 0%)
shubham@shubham-Lenovo-E41-15:~/LinuxAssignment$ mkdir docs2
shubham@shubham-Lenovo-E41-15:~/LinuxAssignment$ ls
docs  docs2  docs.zip  file1.txt
shubham@shubham-Lenovo-E41-15:~/LinuxAssignment$ unzip docs.zip -d docs2
Archive:  docs.zip
   creating: docs2/docs/
 extracting: docs2/docs/file2.txt    
shubham@shubham-Lenovo-E41-15:~/LinuxAssignment$ ls
docs  docs2  docs.zip  file1.txt


File Editing:
a. Open the "file1.txt" file in a text editor and add some text to it.
b. Replace a specific word in the "file1.txt" file with another word (provide the original
word and the word to replace it with). 

answer:

PROBLEM 2: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND ANSWER ACCORDINGLY. IF THERE IS
ANY NEED TO INSERT SOME DATA THEN DO THAT AS WELL.
 

a. Suppose you have a file named "data.txt" containing important information. Display the
first 10 lines of this file to quickly glance at its contents using a command. 

answer: head data.txt

b. Now, to check the end of the file for any recent additions, display the last 5 lines of
"data.txt" using another command. 

answer: tail -n 5 data.txt

c. In a file named "numbers.txt," there are a series of numbers. Display the first 15 lines of
this file to analyze the initial data set. 

answer: head -n 15 numbers.txt

d. To focus on the last few numbers of the dataset, display the last 3 lines of "numbers.txt"

answer: tail -n 3 numbers.txt

e. Imagine you have a file named "input.txt" with text content. Use a command to translate
all lowercase letters to uppercase in "input.txt" and save the modified text in a new file
named "output.txt." 

answer:tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' <input.txt> output.txt

f. In a file named "duplicate.txt," there are several lines of text, some of which are
duplicates. Use a command to display only the unique lines from "duplicate.txt." 

answer: uniq duplicate.txt

g. In a file named "fruit.txt," there is a list of fruits, but some fruits are repeated. Use a
command to display each unique fruit along with the count of its occurrences in
"fruit.txt." 

answer: sort fruit.txt | uniq -c
